[b]Pantheon of the Gods is a new mod inspired by the fantastic work done by many CKII modders to bring us the many fantasy and alternate history mods, most specifically  "The Gods" mod. This is in a similar vein to those great ck2 mods but by no means the same. In fact I have many dramatic and large plans for this mod, even going as far as adding new races, magic systems and a comprehensive and immersion filled storyline. The point of this mod is not to retread the steps of previous mods, but to give a convincing and enthralling alternative history for the normal Crusader Kings setting.[/b]

ðŸŒŸ Traits for Gods, Goddesses and Demi-Gods.
ðŸŒŸ New religions and cultures related to the various god types.
ðŸŒŸ A basic corruption system where you can become a fallen god.
ðŸŒŸ A fleshed out event chain for becoming a god which gives a sneak peak into the lore I will be building into the mod in the future.
ðŸŒŸ Stat increase and inheritance of traits using a new system separate from paradox's congenital trait system.
ðŸŒŸ Dilution of blood through inheritance which can lead to blood of the gods running through families as a congenital 
      trait.
ðŸŒŸ Apotheosis and gifting others the power of godhood.
ðŸŒŸ Blessing and cursing characters, even so far as to give chosen ones the gift of immortality (without god traits).

ðŸŒŸ More expanded traits to do with gods, including a tiered system of power so you can rise to not only be a god, but the most powerful one at that
ðŸŒŸ Education and profession based traits for the divine man or woman.
ðŸŒŸ Fleshed out religions an cultures with already established god characters and pantheons.
ðŸŒŸ Dramatic story based wars against pantheons as they battle for supremacy of the mortal coil.
ðŸŒŸ New regiments and men-at-arms. Fight with an army of angels or demons at your side.
ðŸŒŸ New lifestyle trees to do with powerful divine magic.
ðŸŒŸ Implementation of a magic system that even mortals can access.
ðŸŒŸ Strange new races and creatures, that are deeply connected with their local mythology.
