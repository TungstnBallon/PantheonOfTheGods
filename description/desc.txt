[b]VERSION 2.0 IS HERE: Elves/God Progression/Cultures & More![/b]

Welcome to the second iteration of the mod, there's a whole bunch of shizz that's new so it is mandatory to add in new saves. Coming with this update most notably is new god powers and lifestyle trees for pure and fallen deities. This will allow your god to feel like he/she is progressing gaining cool new abilities along the way. And next of course if a long awaited request. ELVES!!! With the help of the amazing @Mitsu, new elven portraits are available as well as a new culture, religion and trait. Elves get their blood diluted much like gods and become weaker if their blood isn't kept pure. You can find landed elves in the Slavic states in the 867 bookmark date.

Of course there are also many bug fixes, most notably localization, events and culture fixes. No longer shall your culture be hamstringed by no innovations. All god cultures are on par or higher advanced than the vanilla cultures. As well the culture head problem has been fixed.

There are many other amazing new fixes and easter eggs. But I think you will have to find out for yourself!


[b]Pantheon of the Gods is a new mod inspired by the fantastic work done by many CKII modders to bring us the many fantasy and alternate history mods, most specifically  "The Gods" mod. This is in a similar vein to those great ck2 mods but by no means the same. In fact I have many dramatic and large plans for this mod, even going as far as adding new races, magic systems and a comprehensive and immersion filled storyline. The point of this mod is not to retread the steps of previous mods, but to give a convincing and enthralling alternative history for the normal Crusader Kings setting.[/b]

🌟 Traits for Gods, Goddesses and Demi-Gods.

🌟 New religions and cultures related to the various god types.

🌟 A basic corruption system where you can become a fallen god.

🌟 A fleshed out event chain for becoming a god which gives a sneak peak into the lore I will be building into the mod in the future.

🌟 Stat increase and inheritance of traits using a new system separate from paradox's congenital trait system.

🌟 Dilution of blood through inheritance which can lead to blood of the gods running through families as a congenital 
      trait.

🌟 Apotheosis and gifting others the power of godhood.

🌟 Blessing and cursing characters, even so far as to give chosen ones the gift of immortality (without god traits).
