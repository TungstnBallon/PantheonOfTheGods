 pog_war_in_heavens.0001.t:0 "Rise of the Celestials"
 pog_war_in_heavens.0001.desc:0 "Stranger things have happened, but I just received word of events in western Europe. Turmoil has arose in the south of France and the north of Italy as brutal insurgents have arose to take the reins of leadership.The pope to say the least is not pleased and has issued a statement to the Christian world to stamp out this heresy before it spreads to other realms. \n \n At this moment there is a tense stand off taking place in Europe, the Catholic world stands still, waiting on who will make the first move. This could be an insurrection of the likes no person in the Christian world has ever seen."
 pog_war_in_heavens.0001.a:0 "My heart stands still and I pray to the almighty God to protect us in the trying time."
 pog_war_in_heavens.0001.b:0 "The era of Christendom may finally be over, I await news with further anticipation."
