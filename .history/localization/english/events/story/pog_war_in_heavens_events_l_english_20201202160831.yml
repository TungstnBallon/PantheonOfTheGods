 pog_war_in_heavens.0001.t:0 "Rise of the Celestials"
 pog_war_in_heavens.0001.a.desc:0 "Stranger things have happened, but I just received word of events in western Europe. Turmoil has arose in the south of France and the north of Italy as brutal insurgents have arose to take the reins of leadership.The pope to say the least is not pleased and has issued a statement to the Christian world to stamp out this heresy before it spreads to other realms. \n \n At this moment there is a tense stand off taking place in Europe, the Catholic world stands still, waiting on who will make the first move. This could be an insurrection of the likes no person in the Christian world has ever seen."
 pog_war_in_heavens.0001.b.desc:0 "My rise to power has finally been realised. There is now no longer anyone who can stand in my way. The civil war which took place just mere months ago has routed the enemy and my marshals consolidate my power. With my holy word rising like a prayer to the heavens, those who resist also die in agony. My pontification is absolute and the holiness of my mission impervious, but even now the scared nations of Christendom array before me ready to bite at my heals like rabid dogs. The pope, the fool has issued my crusade as heretical and the armies of this earth array before me. \n \n At this moment, the men of the world do not understand the power that I wield, but in the coming months I suspect the many foolish armies will experience it for themselves."
 pog_war_in_heavens.0001.c.desc:0 "For many years I sat at the highest point of my faith. The saviour of mankind, Christ was my muse, and I sought his presence at all times. But things have changed. The angel Michael has appeared to me in a dream telling me of the lies of my forbears. It is now that I have finally made that error right. I preached the holy word and the called me a heretic, yet the power of the gods of the heavens are ever powerful and with their gift I cast aside all those who opposed me. Though, even now the armies of my former brothers array against me, truly the end times have come, father against brother, mother against daughter, wife against husband. This nightmare may easily tear this world asunder, but I will remain resolute, the strength of Michael flows through me as my love of Christ once did. \n \n At this moment, the divine light of the Celestial gods imbues me with strength, if they force my hand, I will fight, and the nations of God shall fall!"
 pog_war_in_heavens.0001.a:0 "My heart stands still and I pray to the almighty God to protect us in the trying time."
 pog_war_in_heavens.0001.b:0 "The era of Christendom may finally be over, I await news with further anticipation."
 pog_war_in_heavens.0001.c:0 "The nations of Christ will fall, and the armies of daemonic fury shall sweep the land clean."
 pog_war_in_heavens.0001.d:0 "The world of Angels and Daemons comes down to the earth and I shall gift light to the nations."
