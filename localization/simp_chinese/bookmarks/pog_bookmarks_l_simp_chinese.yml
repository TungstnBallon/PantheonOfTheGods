 bm_867_pantheon_of_the_gods_desc:0 "The time is ripe. The mortal realms stand unawares as mystical forces from other planes of existence seek to take what is theirs. The Aelves and Dwarves flee their homelands to seek new prosperity in the mortal coil. The various pantheons reach out from the oppressive grip of their own realms into the new lands of possibility. \n Many will perish in the days to come, but will you and your dynasty stand the test of time?"
 bookmark_lyklor_desc:0 "The Aelven king Lyklor lived most of his life in the Otherworld, the world of wonder and majesty hidden from the mortal eyes. Nonetheless Lykor and his family have given up the immortality and safety of the existence they once had and have landed on the shores of the slavic coast. Quickly gaining a foothold in the area, Lyklor now seeks to rebuild the splendor of Aelvehndom in the mortal realms, a kingdom that will rival the greatest of the human lands."
