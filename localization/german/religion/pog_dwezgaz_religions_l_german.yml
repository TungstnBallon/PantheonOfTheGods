 honourforge_religion_desc:0 "Though many faiths converge, all Dwezgaz believe in the story of Thurim Honourforge, the first Dwezgaz. He is worshipped as a living deity who through a sacrificial ritual is designated to be reincarnated into a chosen mortal Dwezgaz body. Though many different methods of worship still remain to this day, they all share a reverence for their living god, the rock and soil of the earth and the sanctity and piece of the Undergrowth."

Thus the storied machines of the ancestors are studied and passed down through the ages, though the research of immortality is forbidden."
