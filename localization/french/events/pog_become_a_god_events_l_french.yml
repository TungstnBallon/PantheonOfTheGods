 pog_become_a_god.0001.desc:0 "Ever since I was a child I have heard strange whispers, ones of fantasy, life and death, power and frailty. Some thought me insane, others thought me a mystic. I have dwelt on these thoughts for some days now. Finally I am able the hear the whispers as if they are shouts across a lake of blue glass. They tell me things, strange things. They say that the taste of power and godhood lies but a few inches from me, that the men and women of religion are but here to trick me into denying that I myself have the power of a god if so choose. \n \n As I lie in my bed at night I ponder these strange words, should I revel deeper into the occult whispered heretically in my ears or shall I shut them out for all eternity?"
 pog_become_a_god.0001.a:0 "I fall deeper into the heretical whispers..."
 pog_become_a_god.0001.b:0 "I resolve to never fall into the heresy."
 pog_become_a_god.0002.t:0 "Following the Heresy"
 pog_become_a_god.0002.desc:0 "It has been about a week since I resolved to fall deeper into my own mind. Every day is spent in desperate meditation, seeking the voices that evade me at every turn. As I focus more on the whispers and voices in my head they all but grow quieter. I am growing weary in my efforts..."
 pog_become_a_god.0002.a:0 "I should take a break, there is no harm in resting the mind to further prepare."
 pog_become_a_god.0002.b:0 "I must push on, never give up."
 pog_become_a_god.0002.c:0 "This is pointless, I should stop while I am ahead."
 pog_become_a_god.0003.t:0 "Failure to Learn"
 pog_become_a_god.0003.desc:0 "Unfortunately my current avenue of search has not been nearly effective enough. This has lead to a burnout. In fact I cannot even hear the whispers at all, though surely things will be different in a year or so."
 pog_become_a_god.0003.a:0 "An unfortunate circumstance..."
 pog_become_a_god.0004.t:0 "Eureka!"
 pog_become_a_god.0004.desc:0 "Eureka! While sitting in silence trying to meditate on the voices in my head suddenly I am caught as if by a demon. A spirit consumes me and it is as if I cannot even control my body. He introduces himself as the Magnate an ethereal being hidden between the plains of existence. \n He explains to me that if I want to be given the gifts of a god I must first find the Book of Sorrows, an ancient text which will allow him to break through the veil of the world and assist me. Only with his help will I be able to become a living deity he says."
 pog_become_a_god.0004.a:0 "What a revelation, I shall do what he says!"
 pog_become_a_god.0004.b:0 "Indeed, I shall keep a close eye on him."
 pog_become_a_god.0005.t:0 "Nearing the Book of Sorrows"
 pog_become_a_god.0005.desc:0 "I have felt it for many days now, the urge of the spirit inside me, pushing me towards my goal. As I near my goal I start to feel different as well. My mind is clearer, my step stronger. It is as if every part of my body grows stronger as the voices begin to shout even louder. \n As I grow closer to my destination I see a gorge fifty feet across stopping my path. I know I must ford the cavernous crack in the world to reach the ancient tome, yet how do I reach across such an expanse?"
 pog_become_a_god.0005.a:0 "My mind is clear, I can create a makeshift bridge across."
 pog_become_a_god.0005.b:0 "My legs feel strong, I am sure I can jump across the expanse."
 pog_become_a_god.0006.t:0 "Reaching the Hidden Chamber"
 pog_become_a_god.0006.desc:0 "Finally, after all this time I have reached the hidden chamber. It's towers rise majestically into the air as it is surrounded by thick marshlands. I near the tower and as I grow closer the voices in my head begin to feverishly chatter, their excitement is imparted to me. I begin to sweat profusely in anticipation, my mouth watering as I grow closer, the air seems almost heavy, heavy with power. \n When I reach the door and open it, there in the centre of the tower lying on the awning is the Book of Sorrows in all it's glory."
 pog_become_a_god.0006.a:0 "Wonderful, I can already feel the divine power from here."
 pog_become_a_god.0006.b:0 "I must leave this place at once, I have changed my mind."
 pog_become_a_god.0007.t:0 "The Final Choice"
 pog_become_a_god.0007.desc:0 "I draw near to the book laying gently. The power from it's cover is almost electric flowing through my entire body all at once. The power is intoxicating, I can feel my power growing even now. \n Suddenly the voice of the spirit speaks to me again. He says that all I have to do is rip the pages from the book to release him, then he will teach me how to use my divine powers. \n However I sense something the spirit does not want me to know, if I were to place my hand on the book and consume the power inside for myself I would also be able to become divine. Of course it is hard to tell what sort of being I would be after, and it would also probably destroy the spirit entirely."
 pog_become_a_god.0007.a:0 "Yes, I shall play along, the spirit should be shown kindness."
 pog_become_a_god.0007.b:0 "No, only the strong survive, and I am strong."
 pog_become_a_god.0008.t:0 "A Pure Deity"
 pog_become_a_god.0008.desc:0 "As I rip the pages out of the book, an unmistakable power rushes through the entire room. In blinding white light the spirit appears before me in all it's glory. The Magnate tells thanks me for my kindness, he says he is an ethereal being trapped on the mortal plane by a mad god, and that none before you could resist the power given to them to set him free. \n He imparts me with great power then as a rushing wind. The wind of the spirit fills me with love, compassion and kindess. The powers of a god, one that could bring great good into the world. He tells me to be fruitful and multiply, and that I have been gifted the powers of the highest of gods. One that can even gift apotheosis unto others."
 pog_become_a_god.0008.a:0 "The spirit leaves me renewed."
 pog_become_a_god.0009.t:0 "A Fallen Deity"
 pog_become_a_god.0009.desc:0 "Immediately a blinding rage fills my heart, almost like a black plague. I place my hand on the cover of the book and think inward to all the hatred and all the pain I hold within me. With great malice black ink sprouts from my hand and drenches the book. I hear the screams of the spirit as it is turned inside out, corrupted and consumed by my black magic. It is at that point I realize the truth, I am the Mad God. I am the one responsible for holding this spirit hostage, I am the destroyer of men, women and children alike. As the power of a thousand gods flows through me I know deep in my corrupted heart that I even now possess the ability to create a progeny, one which could blot out the sun."
 pog_become_a_god.0009.a:0 "With my power I consume the last of the spirit."
 pog_become_a_god.1000.t:0 "Discipleship Completed"
 pog_become_a_god.1000.desc:0 "Finally, after months of preparation and cunning I have garnered was I need to sway [target.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroductionNoComma', ROOT.Char)] in the fold. From this day forward [target.GetSheHe] will be a most fervent disciple, spreading my word to the many nations of this world."
 pog_become_a_god.1000.a:0 "Welcome to the fold my young mortal."
 pog_become_a_god.1002.t:0 "Apotheosis Reached"
 pog_become_a_god.1002.desc:0 "Finally, after months of preparation I have cultivated my divine power in a way as to make [target.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroductionNoComma', ROOT.Char)] stronger, faster and smarter. In but a few moments [target.GetSheHe] become a deity, a living god in this mortal world. Who can tell what heights I will reach!"
 pog_become_a_god.1002.a:0 "Welcome to the hall of gods."
