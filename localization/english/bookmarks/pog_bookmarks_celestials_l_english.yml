The civil war that raged the plains of Avalon has now been taken up again, a war of the old against the new arises once more. Who even knows why the Courts of the Fae let the Aëlves leave their homesteads, perhaps their plans stretch beyond the plane of Annwfn and into the mortal realm?\n\n#bold Many trials await, mothers will weep and fathers cry out for their children. The fates have yet to determine who will reign superior and inherit the world of mortals...#"

 bm_867_the_old_gods_desc:0 "Millenia ago, the ancient gods of Tyre, Egypt and the Levant held the ancient world in the palm of their hands. Civilizations rose and fell at their whims. Nobody knows why they disappeared though one thing is for sure, they have returned. In the east the ancient gods of Egypt rise again, unlike others the old gods have no home other than the mortal plane, and they lay dominion over it.\n\n#bold The Old Gods rise again, they lay a curse upon the living, for the sands will rise once more and engulf the civilizations of man. Those who do not bend the knee shall be ground to dust...#"

He has been tasked with bringing darkness and the forces of Lucifer low, and grinding them into dust underneath the heals of light!"
