 pog_religion_culture.0000.desc:0 "It has been may days since my encounter with the Book of Sorrows. Without a doubt my actions were correct. Today I woke up feeling stronger than I ever have, I found I am able to down opponents exceptionally quick, and a few courtiers have noted my composure and my aura of light. \n However, while sitting at my table I hear a rumble and a shimmer, then suddenly a spirit rushes forth from underneath me, it is the Magnate once again. He tells me that he is very pleased with his choice and that he would sponsor me if I wanted to join one of the many pantheons of the world."

 pog_religion_culture.00000.desc:0 "It has been a few days since my encounter with the Book of Sorrows, and I can say that I am enjoying the fruits of my search. Already my power grows to a point that no mortal can even stand to look at my face if I don't wish them to do so. Those in my court who I despise cower in fear. \n Though, while inspecting my camp I begin to once again hear the voice of the mad god. He speaks clearly, telling me that he would offer patronage to me so that I may join one of the many pantheons on the mortal plane."
