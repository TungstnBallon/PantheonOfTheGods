  trait_elf:0 "Aëlf"
  trait_elf_desc:0 "The graceful Aëlves hail from the Otherworld, and have been called many names. Many fled a mysterious conflict they faced there, and warped to the mortal realms, while others have followed in pursuit of those that fled. Aëlves come in several different forms; from the passionate and mercurial Nöx Cërdå, to the reserved and devout Lúx Cërdå, and finally the traditional Aos Sí. The Aëlves have a great affinity for magic in its myriad forms, and a comprehension of the natural world that is unmatched."
  trait_half_elf:0 "Mítle-Aëlf"
  trait_half_elf_desc:0 "Mítle-Aëlves are the diluted blood children of pure blood Aëlves. While they may look very similar to normal Aëlves depending on their ancestry, they do not possess the same aptitude for sorcery or natural connection to the world around them."
